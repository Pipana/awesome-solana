Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **The submitted project should be more than 30 days old.**
- Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.
- Keep in mind that the list is not very mature, so the bar of getting something accepted could be low.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Descriptions should not be marketing taglines.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the project and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

Thank you for your suggestion!

### Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
