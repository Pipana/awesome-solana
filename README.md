Just type solana.cool to go here.

This repo is a not ready for pubic consumption. Work needs to be done to at least fill out all that the solana.com/ecosystem website lists and then we can expand it from there.

The links should be twitter-centric when possible. CT is a reliable entry point for most projects we might list. Fallback to a website, GitHub repo, or another logical choice.
