# awesome-solana [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)


Please fork and help build this out. Non-devs contact @FranTiberious for help learning GitHub processes for becoming a contributer/maintainer. :) 

Just type solana.cool to go here.

This repo is a not ready for pubic consumption. Work needs to be done to at least fill out all that the solana.com/ecosystem website lists and then we can expand it from there.

Since we are using solana.com/ecosystem as a link list to get us started we should be aware that some projects listed belong to multiple categories. We should choose a primary category only for this awesome-list format.

The links should be twitter-centric when possible. CT is a reliable entry point for most projects we might list. Fallback to a website, GitHub repo, or another logical choice.


Read the Awesome manifesto and list guidelines and ensure this list complies.
